vim:

for mac OS the alternatives for getting a WM is yabai with skhd or amethyst though yabai is better imo
yes, yabai is pretty awesome, and cmd 1~x switches workspace instantly no transition bs.

Iâ€™m still using skhd and love it. Will move to yabai at some point.
Is there a difference with Amethys? I would like to get started with one asap (yabai isn't on homebrew, is it?)
it is on homebrew on the custom tap of the maintainer of yabai
brew tap koekeishiya/formulae
brew install yabai
you should also install skhd
to make mappings for yabai

You should install Alacritty (or Kitty)
